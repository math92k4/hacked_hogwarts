You can filter, sort, and search the student-list. 
You can expell students, and they will end on a seperate list. 
You can prefect students, but only one boy and one girl for each house.
You can add full-blood sletherins to inq-squad.
You can mess up the logic, by typing "hackTheSystem();" in console.
